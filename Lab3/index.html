               The Game Awards 2021 was an award show that honored the best video games of 2021. The event was hosted by Geoff Keighley, creator and producer of The Game Awards, and was held to an invited audience at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on December 9, 2021.

               The preshow ceremony was hosted by Sydnee Goodman. The event was live streamed across more than 40 digital platforms. It featured musical performances from Imagine Dragons, JID, Darren Korb, and Sting, and presentations from celebrity guests including Reggie Fils-Aimé, Keanu Reeves, Ben Schwartz, and Ming-Na Wen. Activision Blizzard was excluded from the show outside of its nominated games after the company was sued by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on allegations of sexual harassment and employee discrimination in July 2021; Keighley's comments about the company received some criticism.

               Deathloop led the show with nine nominations; it won Best Game Direction and Best Art Direction. Forza Horizon 5 and It Takes Two tied for the most wins with three awards, and the latter also won Game of the Year. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy was awarded Best Narrative, and Maggie Robertson won Best Performance for her role as Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village. Several new games were announced during the show, including Alan Wake II, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, and Sonic Frontiers, and the first full trailers for Halo and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 premiered. The show was viewed by over 85 million streams. It received mixed reviews, with some praise directed at new game announcements and criticism for its length and focus on announcements over awards.

                Nominees were announced on November 16, 2021. Any game released for public consumption on or before November 19, 2021 was eligible for consideration. The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of members from 103 media outlets globally. Winners were determined between the jury (90%) and public voting (10%); the latter was held via the official website and on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Bilibili until December 8.The exception is the Players' Voice award, fully nominated and voted-on by the public

               the winner was announced on December 8 after three rounds of voting. Specialized juries decided the nominees and winners for categories such as accessibility and esports. Voting for the best esports team category was also held through the show's Discord server and through direct messages on Twitter. More than 23.2 million votes were submitted on the official website, a 27 percent increase over the previous year.

               Keighley found that his ownership of the show led to him receiving blame for snubs in nominations, despite not being involved in the voting process.Regarding potential winners, Keighley felt that "it's kind of anyone's game this year", but that, as the show's producer, he often prefers shows like The Game Awards 2018 with the rivalry between God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2.He noted that future shows could see the addition of awards for adaptations and user-generated content, but felt that "there's just not enough yet".

               Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World praised the game for its dark, detailed combat
               <img src="./res/matrix.jpg">
               simulation with "ten strange and wonderful worlds
               filled with alien creatures and constructs". The game was "aggressively" priced at US$29.95. However, he found the controls confusing and the futuristic vocabulary contrived.
               In addition, the README file contained solutions to all of the puzzles in the game.
               In 2008, work began on porting the game to Linux and other
               operating systems, utilizing the SDL library for cross-platform compatibility.

               In April 2014 the new version was digitally re-released on Steam and later on the DRM-free service GOG.com for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.
               Unfortunately, multiplayer support has been removed. In March 2016, the Vangers source code was released under the GNU GPL-3.0-only license.
               As the art content was not released as freely redistributable freeware (or open content), the data files from the digital re-releases on GOG.com and Steam
               are required to run the game.
